# Clean-Code-And-Clean-Architecture
Project created with the purpose of applying and practicing standards such as Clean Code, Clean Architecture, semantic Commits, code refactoring and TDD.

Some tools used in this project:
- Typescript
- Jest
- Husky
- Commitlint

Commit pattern:
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
